Instructions
------------

The GTAVMenuExample/ folder and the compiled GTAVMenuExample.asi go in the 
root GTA V folder. A GTAVMenuExample.log is generated on load and some 
actions.  

In the img/ folder, images can be placed which are picked up by the 
`"imagemenu"` submenu. Currently jpg and png images are supported.
